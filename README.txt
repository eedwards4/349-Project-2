+
+
============================

The program will return the difference in travel times recorded between two entities travelling a shared distance.


To use this program, simply run the program with between 0 and 2 of your desired files as an argument:

        E.G [travelTimer myInput.txt] [travelTimer myInput.txt myOutput.txt] [travelTimer]

The first argument will always be considered an input file, and the second argument will always be considered an output
file. If an output file is not provided, the user will be prompted to overwrite an existing file or create a new output
file. If an input file is not found or not provided, the program will refuse to continue and offer the user to close the
program.

Files must either be in the same folder as the program executable or be dictated as a full filepath
[E.G /home/myFile.txt]
